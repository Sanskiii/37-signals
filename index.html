			<div class="number">1</div>
			<div class="title">Useful is forever</div>
			<p>
			Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
			</p>
			<div class="number">2</div>
			<div class="title">Great service is everything</div>
			<p>
			We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.
			</p>
			<div class="number">3</div>
			<div class="title">Clarity is king</div>
			<p>
			Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly
			</p>
			<div class="number">4</div>
			<div class="title">Our customers are our investors</div>
			<p>
			Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column-right">
			<div class="number">5</div>
			<div class="title">The basics are beautiful</div>
			<p>
			We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.
			</p>
			<div class="number">6</div>
			<div class="title">No hidden fees or secret prices</div>
			<p>
			We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
			</p>
			<div class="number">7</div>
			<div class="title">Software should be easy</div>
			<p>
			Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.
			</p>
			<div class="number">8</div>
			<div class="title">Long-term contracts are obscene</div>
			<p>
			No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
